Row-level security (RLS) enables you to use group membership or execution context to control access to rows in a database table. For example, you can ensure that workers access only those data rows that are pertinent to their department. Another example is to restrict customers' data access to only the data relevant to their company in a multitenant architecture. The feature is similar to row-level security in [SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/row-level-security?view=fabric&preserve-view=true).

Row-level security simplifies the design and coding of security in your application. Row-level security helps you implement restrictions on data row access.

The access restriction logic is in the database tier, not in any single application tier. The database applies the access restrictions every time data access is attempted, from any application or reporting platform including Power BI. This makes your security system more reliable and robust by reducing the surface area of your security system. Row-level security only applies to queries on a Warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint in Fabric. Power BI queries on a warehouse in Direct Lake mode will fall back to Direct Query mode to abide by row-level security.

Implement RLS by using the[CREATE SECURITY POLICY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-security-policy-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) Transact-SQL statement, and predicates created as [inline table-valued functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/user-defined-functions/create-user-defined-functions-database-engine?view=fabric&preserve-view=true).

Row-level security is applied to [shared warehouse or lakehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/share-warehouse-manage-permissions), because the underlying data source hasn't changed.

Row-level security in Fabric Data Warehouse supports predicate-based security. Filter predicates silently filter the rows available to read operations.

Access to row-level data in a table is restricted by a security predicate defined as an inline table-valued function. The function is then invoked and enforced by a security policy. For filter predicates, the application is unaware of rows that are filtered from the result set. If all rows are filtered, then a null set will be returned.

Filter predicates are applied while reading data from the base table. They affect all get operations:`SELECT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`. Each table must have its own row-level security defined separately. Users who query tables without a row level security policy will view unfiltered data.

Users can't select or delete rows that are filtered. The user can't update rows that are filtered. But it's possible to update rows in such a way that they'll be filtered afterward.

Filter predicate and security policies have the following behavior:

*   You can define a predicate function that joins with another table and/or invokes a function. If the security policy is created with`SCHEMABINDING = ON`(the default), then the join or function is accessible from the query and works as expected without any additional permission checks.

*   You can issue a query against a table that has a security predicate defined but disabled. Any rows that are filtered or blocked aren't affected.

*   If a dbo user, a member of the `db_owner` role, or the table owner queries a table that has a security policy defined and enabled, the rows are filtered or blocked as defined by the security policy.

*   Attempts to alter the schema of a table bound by a schema bound security policy will result in an error. However, columns not referenced by the predicate can be altered.

*   Attempts to add a predicate on a table that already has one defined for the specified operation results in an error. This will happen whether the predicate is enabled or not.

*   Attempts to modify a function, that is used as a predicate on a table within a schema bound security policy, will result in an error.

*   Defining multiple active security policies that contain non-overlapping predicates, succeeds.

Filter predicates have the following behavior:

*   Define a security policy that filters the rows of a table. The application is unaware of any rows that are filtered for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. Including situations where all the rows are filtered out. The application can `INSERT` rows, even if they will be filtered during any other operation.

Creating, altering, or dropping security policies requires the `ALTER ANY SECURITY POLICY` permission. Creating or dropping a security policy requires `ALTER` permission on the schema.

Additionally, the following permissions are required for each predicate that is added:

*   `SELECT` and `REFERENCES` permissions on the function being used as a predicate.

*   `REFERENCES` permission on the target table being bound to the policy.

*   `REFERENCES` permission on every column from the target table used as arguments.

Security policies apply to all users, including dbo users in the database. Dbo users can alter or drop security policies however their changes to security policies can be audited. If members of roles like Administrator, Member, or Contributor need to see all rows to troubleshoot or validate data, the security policy must be written to allow that.

If a security policy is created with`SCHEMABINDING = OFF`, then to query the target table, users must have the `SELECT` or `EXECUTE` permission on the predicate function and any additional tables, views, or functions used within the predicate function. If a security policy is created with`SCHEMABINDING = ON`(the default), then these permission checks are bypassed when users query the target table.

Consider and prepare for the following two scenarios.

It is important to observe that a malicious security policy manager, with sufficient permissions to create a security policy on top of a sensitive column and having permission to create or alter inline table-valued functions, can collude with another user who has select permissions on a table to perform data exfiltration by maliciously creating inline table-valued functions designed to use side channel attacks to infer data. Such attacks would require collusion (or excessive permissions granted to a malicious user) and would likely require several iterations of modifying the policy (requiring permission to remove the predicate in order to break the schema binding), modifying the inline table-valued functions, and repeatedly running select statements on the target table. We recommend you limit permissions as necessary and monitor for any suspicious activity. Activity such as constantly changing policies and inline table-valued functions related to row-level security should be monitored.

It is possible to cause information leakage by using carefully crafted queries that use errors to exfiltrate data. For example, `SELECT 1/(SALARY-100000) FROM PAYROLL WHERE NAME='John Doe';` would let a malicious user know that John Doe's salary is exactly $100,000. Even though there is a security predicate in place to prevent a malicious user from directly querying other people's salary, the user can determine when the query returns a divide-by-zero exception.

We can demonstrate row-level security Warehouse and SQL analytics endpoint in Microsoft Fabric.

The following example creates sample tables that will work with Warehouse in Fabric, but in SQL analytics endpoint use existing tables. In the SQL analytics endpoint, you cannot `CREATE TABLE`, but you can `CREATE SCHEMA`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, and `CREATE SECURITY POLICY`.

In this example, first create a schema `sales`, a table `sales.Orders`.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA sales;
GO

-- Create a table to store sales data
CREATE TABLE sales.Orders (
    SaleID INT,
    SalesRep VARCHAR(100),
    ProductName VARCHAR(50),
    SaleAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    SaleDate DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO sales.Orders (SaleID, SalesRep, ProductName, SaleAmount, SaleDate)
VALUES
    (1, 'Sales1@contoso.com', 'Smartphone', 500.00, '2023-08-01'),
    (2, 'Sales2@contoso.com', 'Laptop', 1000.00, '2023-08-02'),
    (3, 'Sales1@contoso.com', 'Headphones', 120.00, '2023-08-03'),
    (4, 'Sales2@contoso.com', 'Tablet', 800.00, '2023-08-04'),
    (5, 'Sales1@contoso.com', 'Smartwatch', 300.00, '2023-08-05'),
    (6, 'Sales2@contoso.com', 'Gaming Console', 400.00, '2023-08-06'),
    (7, 'Sales1@contoso.com', 'TV', 700.00, '2023-08-07'),
    (8, 'Sales2@contoso.com', 'Wireless Earbuds', 150.00, '2023-08-08'),
    (9, 'Sales1@contoso.com', 'Fitness Tracker', 80.00, '2023-08-09'),
    (10, 'Sales2@contoso.com', 'Camera', 600.00, '2023-08-10');
```

Create a `Security` schema, a function `Security.tvf_securitypredicate`, and a security policy `SalesFilter`.

```sql
-- Creating schema for Security
CREATE SCHEMA Security;
GO
 
-- Creating a function for the SalesRep evaluation
CREATE FUNCTION Security.tvf_securitypredicate(@SalesRep AS nvarchar(50))
    RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
    RETURN SELECT 1 AS tvf_securitypredicate_result
WHERE @SalesRep = USER_NAME() OR USER_NAME() = 'manager@contoso.com';
GO
 
-- Using the function to create a Security Policy
CREATE SECURITY POLICY SalesFilter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE Security.tvf_securitypredicate(SalesRep)
ON sales.Orders
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

To modify a row level security function, you must first drop the security policy. In the following script, we drop the policy `SalesFilter` before issuing an `ALTER FUNCTION` statement on `Security.tvf_securitypredicate`. Then, we recreate the policy `SalesFilter`.

```sql
-- Drop policy so we can change the predicate function.
DROP SECURITY POLICY SalesFilter;
GO

-- Alter the function for the SalesRep evaluation
ALTER FUNCTION Security.tvf_securitypredicate(@SalesRep AS nvarchar(50))
    RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
    RETURN SELECT 1 AS tvf_securitypredicate_result
WHERE @SalesRep = USER_NAME() OR USER_NAME() = 'president@contoso.com';
GO
 
-- Re-create a Security Policy
CREATE SECURITY POLICY SalesFilter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE Security.tvf_securitypredicate(SalesRep)
ON sales.Orders
WITH (STATE = ON);
GO
```

Column-level security simplifies the design and coding of security in your application, allowing you to restrict column access to protect sensitive data. For example, ensuring that specific users can access only certain columns of a table pertinent to their department.

The access restriction logic is located in the database tier, not in any single application tier. The database applies the access restrictions every time data access is attempted, from any application or reporting platform including Power BI. This restriction makes your security more reliable and robust by reducing the surface area of your overall security system.

---------------------------------------------------

In addition, column-level security is simpler and than designing additional [views](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/views?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) to filter out columns for imposing access restrictions on the users.

Implement column-level security with the[GRANT](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/grant-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) T-SQL statement. For simplicity of management, assigning permissions to roles is preferred to using individuals.

Column-level security is applied to [shared warehouse or lakehouse accessed through a SQL analytics endpoint](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/share-warehouse-manage-permissions), because the underlying data source hasn't changed.

Only Microsoft Entra authentication is supported. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra authentication as an alternative to SQL authentication in Microsoft Fabric](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/entra-id-authentication).

Examples
--------

This example will create a table and will limit the columns that `charlie@contoso.com` can see in the `customers` table.

SQL Copy

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Customers
  (CustomerID int,
   FirstName varchar(100) NULL,
   CreditCard char(16) NOT NULL,
   LastName varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   Phone varchar(12) NULL,
   Email varchar(100) NULL);
```

We will allow Charlie to only access the columns related to the customer, but not the sensitive `CreditCard` column:

SQL Copy

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON Customers(CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email) TO [Charlie@contoso.com];
```

Queries executed as `charlie@contoso.com` will fail if they include the `CreditCard` column:

SQL Copy

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

Output Copy

```output
Msg 230, Level 14, State 1, Line 12
The SELECT permission was denied on the column 'CreditCard' of the object 'Customers', database 'ContosoSales', schema 'dbo'.
```


## SQL Granular Permissions - Microsoft Fabric

Markdown Content:
**Applies to:** âœ… SQL analytics endpoint and Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

When the default permissions provided by assignment to workspace roles or granted through item permissions are insufficient, standard SQL constructs are available for more granular control.

For SQL analytics endpoint and Warehouse:

*   Object-level-security can be managed using [GRANT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/grant-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true), [REVOKE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/revoke-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true), and [DENY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/deny-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) T-SQL syntax.
*   Users can be assigned to SQL roles, both custom and built-in database roles.

*   In order for a user to connect to the database, the user must be assigned to a Workspace role or assigned the item **Read** permission. Without **Read** permission at a minimum, the connection fails.
*   If you'd like to set up a user's granular permissions before allowing them to connect to the warehouse, permissions can first be set up within SQL. Then, they can be given access by assigning them to a Workspace role or granting item permissions.

*   `CREATE USER` cannot be explicitly executed currently. When `GRANT` or `DENY` is executed, the user is created automatically. The user will not be able to connect until sufficient workspace level rights are given.

When a user connects to the SQL connection string, they can view the permissions available to them using the [sys.fn_my_permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-functions/sys-fn-my-permissions-transact-sql?view=fabric&preserve-view=true) function.

User's database scoped permissions:

```
SELECT *
FROM sys.fn_my_permissions(NULL, 'Database');
```

User's schema scoped permissions:

```
SELECT *
FROM sys.fn_my_permissions('<schema-name>', 'Schema');
```

User's object-scoped permissions:

```
SELECT *
FROM sys.fn_my_permissions('<schema-name>.<object-name>', 'Object');
```

When connected via the SQL connection string, a user with elevated permissions can query granted permissions by using system views. This doesn't show the users or user permissions that are given to users by being assigned to workspace roles or assigned item permissions.

```
SELECT DISTINCT pr.principal_id, pr.name, pr.type_desc, 
 pr.authentication_type_desc, pe.state_desc, pe.permission_name
FROM sys.database_principals AS pr
INNER JOIN sys.database_permissions AS pe
 ON pe.grantee_principal_id = pr.principal_id;
```

You can secure column filters and predicate-based row filters on tables in Warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint to roles and users in Microsoft Fabric. You can also mask sensitive data from non-admins using dynamic data masking.
