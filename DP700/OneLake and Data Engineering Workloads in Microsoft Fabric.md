*   Shortcuts: Pointers to data stored in different locations, both internal and external to OneLake.
*   Mirroring: Creates a real-time Fabric replica of data stored outside Fabric.

### Definitions:
> Shortcuts: Pointers within OneLake to data in other storage locations, either internal or external.
> Mirroring: The creation of a real-time replica of data from external sources within Fabric, eliminating complex ETL processes.

## Understanding Delta Tables and File Formats in OneLake 00:02:20

*   Delta Lake file format: A super Parquet format that includes versioning and transaction logs.

### Definitions:
> Parquet: A columnar storage format optimized for analytical workloads, featuring data compression and support for complex data types.
> Delta Lake: An enhanced Parquet format providing versioning and ACID-compliant transactions for data reliability.

## Key Concepts in Analytical Processing 00:03:43

### Definitions:
> Projection: Selecting specific columns needed for a query, optimizing data retrieval.
> Predicates: Applying WHERE clauses to filter rows that meet specific criteria in a query.

## Encoding Types for Data Compression 00:04:27

*   Run-length encoding (RLE): Compresses data by encoding repeating values.

### Definitions:
> Dictionary Encoding: A compression technique that replaces frequently occurring values with index values from a dictionary.
> Run-Length Encoding (RLE): A compression algorithm that reduces storage by encoding repeating data values.
